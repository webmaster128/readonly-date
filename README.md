# readonly-date-esm

An immutable drop-in replacement for JavaScript's Date type.

This is a fork of [readonly-date](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readonly-date).
If things go well we'll get access to this package at some point and can merge
this fork into the original name. You can also follow [this discussion](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1869) for updates.
